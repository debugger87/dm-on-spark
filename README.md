### Which are the top ten algorithms in data mining?

* C4.5

    C4.5 is a suite of algorithms for classification problems in machine learning and data mining. 

* K-Means

    The k-means algorithm is a straightforward and widely used clustering algorithm.

* SVM: Support Vector Machines

    Support vector machines (SVMs), including support vector classifier (SVC) and sup- port vector regressor (SVR), are among the most robust and accurate methods in all well-known data mining algorithms. 

* Apriori

    Apriori is the most fundamental algorithms of frequent pattern and association rule mining.
    
* EM

    The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is a broadly applicable approach to the iterative computation of maximum likelihood (ML) estimates, useful in a variety of incomplete-data problems. 

* PageRank

    PageRank is perhaps the best known link-based ranking algorithm, which also powers the Google search engine.
    
* AdaBoost

    AdaBoost is one of the most influential ensemble methods.
    
* kNN: k-Nearest Neighbors

    k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification finds a group of k objects in the training set that are closest to the test object, and bases the assignment of a label on the predominance of a particular class in this neighborhood.
     
* Naive Bayes

    Naive Bayes is a very important method for classification which is very easy to construct and often does surprisingly well.

* CART: Classification and Regression Trees

    The 1984 monograph, “CART: Classification and Regression Trees,” coauthored by Leo Breiman, Jerome Friedman, Richard Olshen, and Charles Stone (BFOS), repre- sents a major milestone in the evolution of artificial intelligence, machine learning, nonparametric statistics, and data mining.
